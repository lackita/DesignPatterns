# DesignPatterns
Simple implementations of various design patterns, each in its own directory. Each pattern has a Makefile that will allow confirmation using `make test` and clean compiled files with `make clean`.

Additionally, the powerpoint for the presentation given at http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Software-Craftsmanship/events/222541015/ is in the root of the project.
